This is a website based on the sitcom show Community, which is a show I'm currently watching at the moment of making this, thus why I chose this for the subject of my project. I made three HTML pages
and a CSS page to compose this. The three pages are a Home page, a Tour page, and a Majors page. All pages include a dropdown menu at the top right to navigate through the pages.

Home: first page I worked on. This composes of a title bar, Bootstrap carousel of major characters in the show, and social media links for fans of Community's content.

Tour: here someone can register for a tour of the fictional campus after filling out their information. Below that is information of the various rooms where major events of the show take place. This page includes animation which changes the background color and text color from aqua and blue to black and white infinitely.

Majors: depicts all the majors offered at Greendale Community College, as well as a mention within the show. It includes the only GIF used in this project. The major categories have an animation where they go from being blue, to green, yellow, red, and back to blue.
