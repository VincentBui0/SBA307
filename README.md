This is a website based on the sitcom show Community, which is a show I'm currently watching at the moment of making this, thus why I chose this for the subject of my project. I made three HTML pages
and a CSS page to compose this. The three pages are a Home page, a Tour page, and a Majors page. All pages include a dropdown menu at the top right to navigate through the pages.

Home: first page I worked on. This composes of a title bar, Bootstrap carousel of major characters in the show, and social media links for fans of Community's content.

Tour: here someone can register for a tour of the fictional campus after filling out their information. Below that is information of the various rooms where major events of the show take place.

Majors: depicts all the majors offered at Greendale Community College, as well as a mention within the show.
